# Keep-Computer-Active
This script will run every 4.5 minutes.  If the computer is not active in a 4.5 minute span it will move the Mouse, otherwise it will do nothing.  Will never stop running.  You will need to kill the EXE to stop running.

This was created as power settings were unable to influence the eventual sleep that was occuring on a TV (after 8+ hours).
